# matrix-op

This project is a small project used for matrix operation and manipulation.

## Features

> [!NOTE]
> My implementation of matrix operations and the code as a whole may not be as good and optimized right now.

The basic functions **addition** and **multiplication** are currently the main calculations, as well as a **create_with** function that takes a default array or the **new** function that will create an array with a default value.
